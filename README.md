# Project 1 Group 2
 This our first project attempt!
 Group 2: Mary, Ying, Ren√©e 

hi both!

I'd like to share some basic thoughts on our  project to your references
(this is not even a draft, just some random thoughts)

I think we need the following files and materials:
- 1x HTML to start
- 1x CSS for modifying
- 1x JS for coding

Furthermore we need to save following gif-files in a folder 
- rock/paper/scissors/start/end/draw/win/lose/thanks

OK, so much for today

Now wish you all a nice holiday!
